## Install the project.

- Clone the repo https://github.com/elias-chalhoub/social-test-app
- Run composer install
- Run yarn install
- The project uses sail so creating alias will make life easier:
	- Run alias sail='[ -f sail ] && sh sail || sh vendor/bin/sail'
- Run sail up -d
- Run yarn run dev

## About

Based on company needs and tech stack I decided to build the frontend using Vue, so the test can show as much as possible of what can be done with different scenarios and methods.
Project is estimated to be done within 4 hours, but to do it as it should be it took around 16 hours (5H backend, 11 Frontend).

## TODO
* Add more inline docs.
* Implementation of backend and frontend tests.
